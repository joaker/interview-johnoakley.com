      question: "What is a microservice?",
      answer: "An independent, specialized service that performs a single task well",
    },
    {
      question: "How do microservices differ from monoliths?",
      answer: "In a microservice architecture, each microservice focuses on a single task, while a monolithic service will handle multiple tasks",
    },
    {
      question: "How would you design a microservice in NodeJS?",
      answer: "I would use express with the json and winston middleware, with DataDog APM for distributed tracing. I would dockerize the service and use kubernetes for management and service discovery. For inter-service communication, I would use orchestration to manage interactions and dependencies, API gateway to serve as access point and provide load balancing and routing, and implement OAuth for secure sessions management.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why use an API gateway?",
      answer: "An API Gateway provides a single interface to the microservice architecture, and allows for load balancing and routing.",
    },
    {
      question: "How would you secure inter-service communication?",
      answer: "Implement SSL; use hash tokens for credentials; and implement OAuth.",
    },
    {
      question: "What role does logging play in a microservice architecture?",
      answer: "Logging allows for monitoring of application health and performance.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you ensure microservice scalability?",
      answer: "Containerize with docker and manage with kubernetes.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is a service registry and why is it needed?",
      answer: "Service registries are just phone books for services - they track whoâ€™s available and where to find them.",
    }
